# Feasibility DSF Process

A distributed feasibility query runs based on the feasibility process. A feasibility query contains multiple criteria and returns one population count per organization. An organization (usually the Zentrale Antrags- und Registerstelle (ZARS)) requests a feasibility query to start off the process. Once started multiple organizations (usually Datenintegrationszentren (DIZ)) execute this query and report results back.

## High-Level Overview

![fig-1](./docs/feasibility-process-01.png)

As you can see in the figure above, the feasibility query process starts with a `request` message (1) that the ZARS or any other initiating organization sends to itself. By sending this message to the ZARS itself, the Business Process Engine (BPE) of the ZARS can be used to distribute the `execute` messages (2) to all DIZ'es in question. After receiving the `execute` messages, each DIZ will calculate the result and answer with a `result` message (3). The ZARS will accumulate the results and provide the requester with live updates.

## Request and Execute Process in Detail

### Distribute Query

Messages, queries and results are represented by FHIR resources. The following three figures show the entire FHIR
resource flow. In contrast to the figure above, only one DIZ is represented, but both, the ZARS and the DIZ are divided
into its individual components. On the ZARS side the components are the FHIR communication server and the BPE, were the
DIZ contains an additional Blaze FHIR server.

![fig-1](./docs/feasibility-process-02.png)

1. Like in the high-level overview, the process starts with the `request` message. Beside the FHIR [Task][1] resource
   for the message, two other FHIR resources will be sent to the ZARS FHIR server. The first one is the [Measure][2]
   resource specifying the population criteria that are defined in the second resource, the [Library][3]. All three
   resources are put into a transaction [Bundle][4] in order to create all together in one transaction.

2. After the ZARS FHIR server receives the resources, it notifies the ZARS BPE via websocket subscription by
   transmitting the Task resource. The incoming Task resource starts the `request` process that implements the query
   distribution to all appropriate DIZ'es.

3. To each DIZ, an `execute` message is sent via a Task resource.

4. After arriving at the DIZ FHIR communication server, the `execute` Task resource is transferred to the DIZ BPE via
   websocket subscription, starting the `execute` process.

### Execute Query (CQL)

This describes the execute process in case `CQL` is specified as an evaluation strategy.

![fig-1](./docs/feasibility-process-03.png)

5. In each DIZ, the `execute` process starts by fetching the Measure and Library resource created at the ZARS FHIR
   communication server. The resources have to be fetched by the BPE because only Task resources are sent actively
   between organizations and message payload is only fetched in case a process really needs it. FHIR search is used in
   order to fetch both resources in one HTTP request by searching for the Measure resource and including the referenced
   Library resource.

6. In the next step, the `execute` process stores the Measure and Library resources to each configured FHIR server in
   order to be able to execute the [$evaluate-measure][5] operation.

7. The resulting [MeasureReport][6] resources are transferred back to the DIZ BPE.

8. After receiving the MeasureReports, the DIZ BPE extracts the population counts from the MeasureReports and passes it
   the sum to the next step.

### Execute Query (CCDL)

This describes the execute process in case `CCDL` is specified as an evaluation strategy.

![fig-1](./docs/feasibility-process-04.png)

5. In each DIZ, the `execute` process starts by checking the current request rate against the configured rate limit and
   rejects the current and all future requests when the rate limit is exceeded until the BPE is restarted. If the rate
   limit has not been exceeded the process continues by fetching the Measure and Library resource created at the ZARS
   FHIR communication server. The resources have to be fetched by the BPE because only Task resources are sent actively
   between organizations and message payload is only fetched in case a process really needs it. FHIR search is used in
   order to fetch both resources in one HTTP request by searching for the Measure resource and including the referenced
   Library resource.

6. The DIZ BPE extracts the CCDL query from the Library resource and sends it to each configured Flare server.

7. The DIZ Flare servers run the evaluation by transforming the CCDL query into one or more requests compatible with the
   FHIR standard.

8. Each DIZ Flare server collects all results from the FHIR server and sends back a single population count to the BPE.

10. The DIZ BPE send the sum of all population counts to the next step.

### Merging Results

11. The population counts of the FHIR and Flare stores get summed up to a single result count. Based on the result count
    and the resources it downloaded in `5.` a MeasureReport is created. Additionally, it obfuscates the result count
    unless disabled. The DIZ BPE stores this MeasureReport on the DIZ FHIR communication server in order to make it
    available for the ZARS.

12. In its last step, the `execute` process sends a `result` message to the ZARS. The `result` message references the
    MeasureReport, so that it can be retrieved by the ZARS.

### Retrieve Results

![fig-1](docs/feasibility-process-05.png)

10. After arrival, the ZARS FHIR communication server will send the `result` Task resource to the ZARS BPE via websocket subscription. The incoming `result` message will use its correlation ID to match the original `request` process to continue.

11. As part of this process, the MeasureReport resource is fetched from the DIZ.

12. The fetched MeasureReport resource is stored immediately on the ZARS FHIR communication server together with the updated Task resource. The Task resource references the MeasureReport resource in its output parameter, in order to make it available to the initial requester.

## Supported Query Types

This process supports the following query types within the transferred Library resource:

| Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                     | Mime Type                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| CQL               | Standardized query format. See https://cql.hl7.org/ for more information.                                                                                       | `text/cql`                 |
| CCDL              | Internal query representation as defined in [this project](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/clinical-cohort-definition-language) in JSON format. | `application/sq+json`      |
| FHIR Search Query | Standardized FHIR search query. See https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html for more information.                                                                  | `application/x-fhir-query` |

> [!NOTE]
> Although a FHIR search query can be transferred to the process no result will be calculated!

## Result Obfuscation

The process ensures obfuscation of a DIZ's real evaluation numbers by rounding them to the nearest ten. Real numbers are solely present in an intermediary step for obfuscation purposes. None of these non obfuscated numbers get persisted unless obfuscation gets explicitly disabled.

## Request Process as BPMN Model

![fig-1](./docs/feasibilityRequest.png)

In the [Business Process Model and Notation][7] (BPMN) model of the `request` process, the start message is the `request` message. After selecting the request targets (the DIZ'es), the `execute` messages are send in the next step. After that a subprocess is started for each target, which will wait for the `result` message to arrive. After the result message of each DIZ is stored immediately, the results are aggregated. After Subprocess the task resource is prepared for further evaluation.

## Execute Process as BPMN Model

![fig-1](./docs/feasibilityExecute.png)

The BPMN model of the `execute` process is straightforward and already explained in detail above.

## Configuration

The feasibility plugin needs configuration for the execute process, which should only be activated by organization with
the role *DIC* in their parent organization(s). This configuration consists of environment variables and a configuration
file in YAML format.

### Environment Variables

Besides the [common DSF settings controlled by different environment variables][8], there is one additional specific to this process.

> [!NOTE]
> All of them share the same prefix `DE_MEDIZININFORMATIK_INITIATIVE_FEASIBILITY_DSF_PROCESS_`.

| EnvVar                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                    | Default  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| CONFIGURATION_FILE                      | Sets the path to the configuration YAML file configuring the stores for the parent organization(s) for executing feasibility queries.                                          | `null`   |

### Configuration File

The configuration file is a YAML formatted text file containing the configuration for the FHIR store(s) which will be
used for executing feasibility queries. It is separated into 2 main parts:

  * the section `stores` configures the access to the FHIR store(s) including the evaluation strategy to be used, the base
    URL and authentication options.
  * the section `networks` sets the stores, whether results should be obfuscated or not and the request rate limit for
    each parent organization the local organization is part of and has the role *DIC*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The configuration file needs to be accessible by the BPE process where the feasibility process plugin is deployed. If
> you are using docker it needs to be mounted inside the BPE docker container. The path to this file has to be
> configured for the feasibility process plugin using the environment variable shown in the section
> **Environment Variables** above.

The following code block shows the configuration structure with all available options including descriptions and the
relation to the now unsupported environment variables used in versions before 1.0.1.0:

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each store configuration in the section `stores` can only use **one** of the following authentication methods: `basicAuth`,
> `bearerAuth` and `oAuth`. A client certificate can be combined with each of the other authentication methods.

The following code block shows an example configuration for 2 parent organizations and 2 FHIR stores using TLS encrypted
communication with a self-signed server certificate, one requiring OpenID Connect authentication and CCDL queries and
the other a client certificate and CQL queries. One of the stores and the OpenID Connect provider are only accessible
via a forward proxy using basic authentication:

```yaml
stores:
  my-production-store:
    baseUrl: https://store.my-organization.de
    evaluationStrategy: ccdl
    requestTimeout: 20000
